### Monte Carlo Simularion 

The Monte Carlo methodology is a statistical technique that involves the use of random sampling to perform simulations and estimate numerical results. The method is named after the famous Monte Carlo casino, known for its games of chance based on random events. 

# Automated Simulations

The platform aims to provide automated simulations using the Monte Carlo methodology with a simple linear regression model. The linear regression model is defined as follows:

Yᵢ = β₁ + β₂Xᵢ + μᵢ

In this equation, Yᵢ represents the dependent variable, Xᵢ is the independent variable, β₁ and β₂ are the model parameters (intercept and slope, respectively), and μᵢ is the error term.

The Monte Carlo simulation technique allows for generating multiple realizations of the model by sampling from random input values. This process helps estimate the model parameters (β₁ and β₂) and evaluate the uncertainty associated with these estimates. By running simulations with different input values, the platform can obtain a distribution of results, providing insights into the potential range of outcomes.

Users of the platform can specify the number of simulations to be performed and define the range or distribution of values for the independent variable(s). The platform then automatically runs the simulations, estimates the model parameters, and provides the resulting distributions or summary statistics. This capability enables users to assess the variability and uncertainty in the model's predictions, making it a valuable tool for decision-making, risk analysis, or sensitivity analysis in various fields.
